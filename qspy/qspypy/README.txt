About qutestpy
==============
This directory used to contain the Python package "qspypy" for 
writing Python test scripts for the QUTest unit testing harness.
"qspypy" had been originally contributed by Dominic Valentino from
Lotus Engineering LLC (https://lotusengineeringllc.weebly.com/).

Note about Obsolescence
=======================
The "qspypy" Python interface to the QUTest unit testing harness
is now considered obsolete and has been superseded by the new, simpler
"py/qutest.py" interface. "qspypy" is no longer provided or supported
by Quantum Leaps and is NOT RECOMMENDED for writing new test scripts.
