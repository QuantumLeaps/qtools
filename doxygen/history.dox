@section qtools_6_0_2 Version 6.0.2, 2017-11-29
Fixed compilation and linkage on Mac OS for qspy, qclean, qfsgen

Used unsigned integer math in qcalc.tcl


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_9_3 Version 5.9.3, 2017-07-04
Fixed bug#175 "QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET & QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET Record Mislabeled in
QSPY Output" (https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/175/ )

Added bin/qcalc.tcl to the GIT repository (so that it shows up on GitHub).


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_9_1 Version 5.9.1, 2017-05-19
Added the GNU-ARM (EABI) toolset to the QTools Collection for Windows in the
directory `qtools/gnu_arm-eabi`. The addition of the GNU-ARM toolset matches the
changes made to Makefiles in QP/C/C++/nano 5.9.2.

To reduce the size of the QTools for Windows download, the self-extracting
archive `qtools_win32_<ver>.exe` has been prepared with the 7-Zip utility.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_9_0 Version 5.9.0, 2017-05-19
This release adds the @ref qutest "QUTest" (pronounced 'cutest') Unit Testing support to QP/Spy software tracing. Specifically, this release adds a new head-less (console-based) QSPY front-end that, which runs unit tests.

This release also adapts the @ref qspy "QSPY" host utility to support @ref qutest "QUTest" unit testing. Several new commands have been added and the structure of the
code has been expanded.

Also, the @ref qspyview "QSpyView" Visualization extension has been moved to the tcl\ sub-directory (the Tcl script tcl\qspyview.tcl).

The other Quantum Leaps utilities, like @ref qclean "QClean", @ref qfsgen "QFSGen", and @ref qcalc "QCalc" have been updated and greatly improved.

Finally, all utilities in the QTools collection have been documented in the new QTools Manual available online at:
https://state-machine.com/qtools


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_7_0 Version 5.7.0, 2016-09-08
Corrected QSPY software tracing host application to properly display floating point numbers in user-defined trace records (QS_F32() and QS_F64() macros). The problem was with incompatibility between Microsoft VC++ and GCC floating-point format specifications. In the GCC software build (which produces the QSPY executable in the qtools/bin directory), the MS-VC++ floating point format resulted in all zeros (e.g., 0.0000e+000).


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_6_4 Version 5.6.4, 2016-05-04
Added <a target="_blank" class="extern" href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/#QWIN">QWIN GUI</a> to the collection (sub-directory qwin_gui).

Updated the QSPY software tracing host application for the QS trace record name changes introduced in QP 5.6.2.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_5_0 Version 5.5.0, 2015-08-21
Extended the QSPY software tracing host application for **bi-directional**
communication with embedded targets (output and *input* into the
target). Added a @ref qspy_udp "UDP socket" to QSPY, as an extensibility mechanism for
adding external unit testing, GUIs and other "front-ends" to control the embedded targets.

Provided new QSpyView Tcl/Tk extension of the QSPY host application for
control testing, and visualization of the real-time tracing data from
embedded targets at real-time. QSpyView enables developers to rapidly
build both GUI-based and "headless" scripts for their specific
applications (see https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/arm-cm_dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl.html)


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_3_1 Version 5.3.1, 2014-04-21
Corrected the version representation from hex to decimal, to match the change in the QP framework. The version representation missmatch caused problems in parsing newly modified trace records, when the qspy.c implementation was inserted directly into the projects.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_3_0 Version 5.3.0, 2014-03-31
Added new trace records to QSPY host application: QS_QEP_TRAN_HIST, QS_QEP_TRAN_EP, and QS_QEP_TRAN_XP. Changed labels for standard records from Q_ENTRY, Q_EXIT, Q_INIT to ENTRY, EXIT, INIT.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_1_1 Version 5.1.1, 2013-10-15
Fixed the bug in the QSPY host application, which didn't handle
correctly object/functions/signal names longer than 32 characters. The
name limit has been raised to 64 characters and this version also
correctly truncates the names at the limit without printing any garbage
characters.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_1_0a Version 5.1.0a, 2013-09-18
Modified QSPY utility to support changes in QP 5.1.x:

-improved handling of target resets by adding an empty QS record
 before the QS_QP_RESET record. The empty record provides the frame
 delimiter in case the last record in incomplete, so that the
 following QS_QP_RESET record can be recognized.

-improved hanlding of internal object/function/signal dictionaries
 so that symbolic information is displayd for all occurrences of an
 object/function/signal, for which a dictionary record was received.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_5_0_0a Version 5.0.0a, 2013-09-08
Modified QSPY utility to support changes in QP 5.0.x:

-modified the standard trace records QS_QF_TICK, and QS_QF_TIMEEVT_*
 to contain the tick-rate number.

-added trace records QS_TEST_RUN and QS_TEST_FAIL for unit testing.

-added version compatibility level 5.0, whereas specifying version
 -v 4.5 runs qspy in the compatibility mode with QP 4.5.x.

-added Find And Replace Text (FART) utility for Windows


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_5_02 Version 4.5.02, 2012-07-21
Re-designed the QSPY interface to support more flexible parsing
of the trace records in desktop-based simulations (such as Windows
or Qt). Users can provide a custom parsing callback function to
QSPY_config(). Also added QS_RESET() macro to reset the internal
dictionaries (and other cleanup in the future) when the target
resets.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_5_01 Version 4.5.01, 2012-06-25
Added the QS_USR_DICTIONARY() entry for storing dictionaries of
the user trace records. Replaced all remaining sprintf() calls
with snprintf().


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_5_00 Version 4.5.00, 2012-05-26
Re-designed the implementation of the QSPY host application, so
that it can be convenienty included as part of the QP library.
This allows direct QS tracing output to the screen for QP applications
running on the desktop. The QSPY application has been converted from
C++ to plain C for easier integration with QP/C.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_3_00 Version 4.3.00, 2011-11-03
This QSPY version mataches the changes to the critical section
macros made in QP 4.3.00. The QS record names QS_QF_INT_LOCK and
QS_QF_INT_UNLOCK have been replaced with QS_QF_CRIT_ENTRY and
QS_QF_CRIT_EXIT, respectively.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_2_04 Version 4.2.04, 2011-09-27
This QSPY version fixes the bug of incorrect reporting function
or object pointers for which the dictionary records are not
provided and which are repeated in one format line (bug #3405904).
For example, trace record AO.FIFO would report (incorrectly) as
follows:

0014004078 AO.FIFO: Sndr=200009B4 Obj=200009B4
Evt(Sig=00000009,Obj=200009B4, Pool= 0, Ref= 0)
Queue(nFree=  5, nMin=  5)

The Sndr= and Obj= are reported to be the same, but they were not.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_2_01 Version 4.2.01, 2011-08-01
This QSPY version adds generation of sequence diagrams as
files to be processed by MscGen (www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/).
This version adds the option -g<msc_file> to generate .msc
file.

Also, this version of QSPY for Windows allows COM ports
larger than COM9.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_2_00 Version 4.2.00, 2011-07-13
This QSPY version matches the changes made to QS target code in
QP/C/C++ 4.2.xx. These changes include sending the additinal byte
of sender priority in trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,

Additional changes include sending the poolID and refCtr of events
in two bytes instead of just one byte. The changes affect the
following trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET_LAST,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET_LAST,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_LIFO,
- QS_QF_PUBLISH,
- QS_QF_GC_ATTEMPT, and
- QS_QF_GC.

Also, for compatibility with the QP 4.2.xx, this version changes
the defaults as follows:

signal size (-S) from 1 byte to 2 bytes, and

baud rate (-b) from 38400 to 115200

This version adds the following trace record:

QS_QF_TIMEEVT_CTR

The version also adds compatiblity with 64-bit targets (such
as 64-bit linux). This version can accept 8-byte pointers (both
object pointers and function pointers) as well as 64-bit
integers sent in user-defined trace records.

This version also adds the hex format for uint32_t integers
sent in the user-defined trace records.

Finally, this version adds command-line option -v to specify
the corresponding QP version running on the target. The default
version is -v4.2, but by specifying version -v4.1 or -v4.0 will
switch QSPY into the backwards-compatibility mode with the
earlier versions of QP.


------------------------------------------------------
@section qtools_4_1_06 Version 4.1.06, 2011-02-09
This is the intial standalone release of the QSPY host application.
QSPY is still available in the QP/C and QP/C++ distributions, but
other rapid prototyping platforms (such as mbed or Arduino) do not
use the standard QP distributions and have no easy access to the
QSPY tool. For these users, this pre-compiled standalone release
is more convenient.
