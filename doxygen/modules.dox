@brief
Software tracing and testing system

QP/Spy&trade; is a software tracing and testing system specifically designed for embedded systems, such as single chip microcontrollers. The job of QP/Spy is to capture information about an embedded code's execution and send it to the host computer with minimal impact on the real-time performance of the embedded code.

@brief
Unit Testing Harness (Framework)

QUTest&trade; (pronounced 'cutest') is a unit testing harness (a.k.a. unit testing framework), which is specifically designed for deeply embedded systems, but also supports unit testing of embedded code on host computers ("dual targeting"). QUTest is the fundamental tooling for Test-Driven Development (TDD) of QP/C/C++ applications, which is a highly recommended best-practice.

@brief
White space cleanup utility

QS is software tracing system that enables developers to monitor live event-driven QP applications with minimal target system resources and without stopping or significantly slowing down the code. QS is an ideal tool for testing, troubleshooting, and optimizing QP applications. QS can even be used to support acceptance testing in product manufacturing.

@description
QV is a simple **cooperative** kernel (previously called "Vanilla" kernel). This kernel executes active objects one at a time, with priority-based scheduling performed before processing of each event. Due to naturally short duration of event processing in state machines, the simple QV kernel is often adequate for many real-time systems.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qv_overview QV Overview
The QV scheduler is engaged after every RTC step of any @termref{active object} to choose the next active object to execute. The QV scheduler always chooses the highest-priority active object that has any events in its event queue. The QV scheduler then extracts the next event from this queue and dispatches it to the state machine associated with the active object. The state machine runs to completion, after which the QV scheduler runs and the cycle repeats.

Please note that because the state machines always return to the QV scheduler after each RTC step, a single stack can be used to process all state machines (memory-friendly architecture).

The QV scheduler can also very easily detect when all event queues are empty, at which point it can call the idle callback to let the application put the CPU and peripherals to a low-power sleep mode (power-friendly architecture).

Given the simplicity, portability, and low-resource consumption, the QV scheduler is very attractive. It allows you to partition the problem into active objects and execute these active objects orderly. The task-level response of this scheduler is the longest RTC step in the whole system, but because event-driven active objects don’t block, the RTC steps tend to be very short (typically just a few microseconds). Also, often you can break up longer RTC steps into shorter pieces, by posting an event to self and returning (“Reminder” state pattern). The self-posted event then triggers the continuation of longer processing.
