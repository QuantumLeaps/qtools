/*! @page qutest_tut QUTest&trade; Tutorial

@nav{qutest,qutest_unity}

<p>This Tutorial describes how to use the QUTest&trade; unit test harness in a series of progressively advancing examples. The first examples pertain to generic C code completely unrelated to the QP frameworks. These examples are adaptations of tests shipping with the <a href="http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>Unity test framework</b></a>. Later examples in this Tutorial show how to test <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts#HSM" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>hierarchical state machines</b></a> and <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts#Active" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>active objects</b></a>. It is highly recommended to study the simpler examples before the more advanced ones, as the basic information won't be repeated in the later tests.
</p>

As mentioned in the Section \"@ref qutest_how "How does it work?"\", testing with QUTest&trade; always involves two components: (1) a @ref qutest_fixture "test fixture" code written in <b>C</b> (or <b>C++</b>) that runs on the <b>target</b> and (2) one or more @ref qutest_script "test scripts" that are written in <b>Python</b> and run on the <b>host</b>. This Tutorial starts each example with the description of how to run the tests and then explains the *test fixture* and the *test scripts* comprising the test.

@note
This Tutorial should run on any host computer (Windows, Linux, or MacOS), where both QTools&trade; and [<b>QP/C framework</b>](/qpc) have been installed and also the **QTOOLS** environment variable has been defined. Please refer to the @ref gs_obtain "QTools Installation" section for more information about downloading and installing QTools&trade;.


This Tutorial consists of the following lessons:

/*! @page qutest_unity Basic Unity Example

@tableofcontents
@nav{qutest_tut,qutest_mock}

<p>This example is based on the simple `example_1` that ships with the <a href="http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>Unity unit testing framework</b></a>. This simplest example of Unity has nothing to do with the QP frameworks. The purpose is to illustrate that QUTest&trade; can be used with generic C code and to compare QUTest&trade; with Unity.
</p>

@remark
This simple example runs QUTest tests on the host (Windows, Linux, or macOS) for both Unity and QUTest. The QUTest version also runs on embedded boards (NUCLEO-L053R8 from ST, EFM32 Pearl-Gecko board from Silicon Labs and TivaC LaunchPad from Texas Instruments and ). The instructions for building and running the code on the embedded boards are located at the end of this lesson.

@section qutest_unity-cut Code Under Test (CUT)

@note
Because it uses pure C code, the Basic Unity example is only available in the [<b>QP/C framework</b>](https://www.state-machine.com/qpc), and is **not** available in the [QP/C++ framework](https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp).


The CUT in this example is the file <span class="img file_c">`my_strlen.c`</span> located in the directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\src`</span>:

@anchor qutest_tut_basic-cut
@includelineno my_strlen.c


@section qutest_unity-run0 Running the Test with Unity
The complete code for the basic Unity example is provided in the QP/C framework directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\test`</span>. To run the basic Unity test (on Windows), open a command-prompt and type:
@verbatim
cd C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\test
make
@endverbatim

@note
The provided `Makefile` will also work on Linux and macOS. The only difference from Windows is that you open a terminal window and change the directory to <span class="img folder">`~/qp/qpc/examples/qutest/unity_strlen/test`</span>.


This will build the @ref qutest_unity-fixture "test fixture" as a host executable and then it will run it. The screen shot below shows the output produced from the make command.

![Unity example_1 test build and run with Unity](unity_strlen_unity.jpg)


@section qutest_unity-run Running the Test with QUTest
The complete code for the basic Unity example is provided in the QP/C framework directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest`</span>. To run the basic test (on Windows), open a command prompt and type:

@verbatim
qspy
@endverbatim

This will start the @ref qspy "QSPY host utility" with the TCP/IP connection to the Target.

Next, open a **second** command prompt window and type:

@verbatim
cd C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest
make
@endverbatim

@note
The provided `Makefile` will also work on Linux and MacOS. The only difference from Windows is that you open a terminal window and change the directory to <span class="img folder">`~/qp/qpc/examples/qutest/unity_strlen/qutest`</span>.


This will build the @ref qutest_unity-fixture "test fixture" as a host executable and then it will run the @ref qutest_unity-script "test script" (in Python). The screen shot below shows the output produced in these two command-prompt windows.

![Unity example_1 test build and run with QUTest (right) and QSPY output (left)](unity_strlen_qutest.jpg)


@section qutest_unity-fixture Test Fixture
The job of a @ref qutest_fixture "test fixture" is to exercise the **CUT** (<span class="img file_c">`my_strlen.c`</span> in this case) and report the results back to the @ref qspy "QSPY host application". Note that a *test fixture* in QUTest&trade; is **not** supposed to perform any checks whether the CUT operates "correctly". Instead, your *test fixture* should only provide facilities to thoroughly exercise the **CUT** remotely from the  @ref qutest_unity-script "test script"(s). A properly written test fixture can typically be used for many tests (implemented in multiple test scripts).

@remark
Coming up with a "good" *test fixture* requires some practice, but when you study the examples in this Tutorial, you will see some instances of flexible *test fixtures* that allow you to to run a wide variety of tests on them.


The following listing shows the complete QUTest *test fixture* for the basic tests (file <span class="img file_c">`test_strlen.c`</span> in the directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest`</span>).

  </dd>
  <dt>6</dt><dd> The `main()` function must start with calling `QF_init()` to initialize the QP framework.

@section qutest_unity-script Test Script
A **test script** contains a group of related tests (a <em>"test group"</em>). The basic job of these tests is to send inputs to the *test fixture* running in the Target and to compare the @ref qspy_text "QSPY textual output" produced with the <b>expectations</b> of the test. The following listing shows the *test script* (Python) for the Unity basic tests (file <span class="img file_py">`test_strlen.py`</span>). The explanation section following the listing clarifies the interesting lines of code (lines starting with `[xx]` labels).

@remark
Even though a *test script* uses **Python** under the hood, you don't need to be a Python expert to write effective test scripts. The actual set of commands that you use and need to know about forms a small @ref qutest_script "Domain Specific Language (DSL) for unit testing", which just happens to be implemented with Python as a command interpreter.

@note
The following test script performs the same tests as the Unity test fixture <span class="img file_c">`test_strlen.c`</span> in the directory <span class="img folder">`qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest`</span>.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<strong>"preamble"</strong> defines the on-reset code common to all tests in the group:
<dl class="tag">
  <dt>2</dt><dd> The function on_reset() is executed after Target reset.
  </dd>
  <dt>3</dt><dd> The `expect_run()` directive consumes the QF-RUN trace record produced after Target reset.

  <dt>4</dt><dd> The current_obj() command sets the "current object" of the application-specific kind (`OBJ_AP`) in the Target. Subsequent commands (such as poke() in the next step) will act on this "current object".
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<strong>"tests"</strong> performs various tests:
<dl class="tag">
  <dt>5</dt><dd> The test() directive starts a test and gives it a name (in double quotes). The name of the test will be displayed as the test is executed and should be a quick reminder about the objective of this test. This test command also @ref qutest_reset "resets the Target", which brings the Target into a well-defined initial state and produces the @ref qs_dict "QS dictionary records" (see @ref qutest_unity-fixture "test-fixture"[12]).
> <b>NOTE:</b> The ability to perform the <b>full Target reset</b> is a unique feature of QUTest. Other unit testing frameworks, including Unity and CppUTest, don't reset the Target. They merely call the test `setup() / tearDown()` functions at the beginning and end of the test, respectively. QUTest also calls `onReset() / onSetup() / onTeardown()`, but obviously the full Target reset is a much better guarantee that the Target starts in exactly the same state.
  </dd>
  <dt>6</dt><dd> The poke() directive pokes the specified "Application Current Object" starting with the specified offset from the beginning of the object in memory (which here is 0) with the data elements of size 4 (the second argument) with the data provided in the third argument `pack()` "pack("<L", 0x5A5A)" into the previously established "Application Current Object".
  </dd>
  <dt>7</dt><dd> The command() directive causes the invocation of the `QS_onCommand()` callback inside the Target. The argument 0 is the `cmdId` parameter (see @ref qutest_unity-fixture "test-fixture"[16]).
> **NOTE:** The first parameter of command() "command" here is just a number (0), but it is also possible to use a **symbolic name** for the first parameter. This symbolic name will be looked up in the user dictionary (QS_USR_DICTIONARY()).
  </dd>
  <dt>8</dt><dd> The expect() command represents an <b>expectation</b> of this "test assertion". This is the expected output generated by the `command(0)` command from the previous step. You need to consult the test fixture to determine what you should expect in this case.
> <b>NOTE:</b> the expected string starts with a number `0000000001`, which is the @ref qs_tstamp "Target Time-Stamp". In QUTest, the "timestamp" simply counts all the QS trace records produced, so that you know that no entries have been lost. In the later tests you will see how you can count the steps <b>automatically</b> with the `@timestamp` placeholder.
  </dd>
  <dt>8</dt><dd> The test finishes with the expectation for the `Trg-Done QS_RX_COMMAND` trace record, which means that all output generated by command() has been generated.
  </dd>
  <dt>9</dt><dd> This expectation consumes the "Trg-Done QS_RX_COMMAND" trace record, which ensures that *all* output for this command has been produced.
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

@attention
The  QSPY host application limits the @ref qs_dict "QS dictionaries" to the **first 63 characters**. This means that longer names of functions or objects will be **truncated** to this limit. Please keep this limit in mind when choosing various names in your application.


@section qutest_unity-embed Running the Test on Embedded Targets
As mentioned in the initial description of this example, the directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest`</span> contains makefiles to build the code and run the tests on the embedded boards (TivaC LaunchPad from Texas Instruments and EFM32 Pearl-Gecko board from Silicon Labs). Both these boards open a virtual COM port on the machine they are attached to via the USB cable. This virtual COM port provides an ideal connection for the @ref qs "QS communication" with the @ref qspy "QSPY host utility".


![Targets for running QUTests. From the left: host computer, TivaC LaunchPad and EFM32 Pearl-Gecko](platforms.png)


For example, to test the EFM32 Pearl-Gecko board (ARM Cortex-M4), open a command prompt (on Windows) and type:

@verbatim
qspy -c COM6
@endverbatim


This will start the QSPY host utility with com-port connection to the embedded board. Of course, you need to adjust the serial port number to the actual number of the virtual COM port on your machine.

Next, open a **second** command prompt window and type:

@verbatim
cd C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_strlen\qutest
make -f make_efm32
@endverbatim

The rest of the test is then exactly the same as with the host executable described @ref qutest_unity-run "above", except that the @ref qutest_unity-fixture "test fixture" runs on the embedded board.

To run the tests on the TivaC LaunchPad (TM4C123 board), you use the `make_tm4c123` in the last step.

/*! @page qutest_mock Unity Mock Example

@tableofcontents
@nav{qutest_unity,qutest_qhsm}

<p>This example is loosely based on <a href="https://www.electronvector.com/about" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>Matt Chernosky's</b></a> video blog post <a href="https://www.electronvector.com/blog/test-driving-with-mocks-instead-of-hardware" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>"Test-driving with mocks instead of hardware"</b></a>. In this video blog, Matt presents a technique called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>mock object</b></a>, which in the traditional unit testing approach is needed to verify complex, multi-stage interactions between the CUT and the collaborator impersonated by the mock object.
</p>

@note
To better understand this QUTest example, it is highly recommended to watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/256590562" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>Chernosky's video blog</b></a>.


The main purpose of this example is to show the traditional approach (with the mock object) and contrast it with the much simpler solution enabled by the QUTest approach. Of course, to  make comparisons meaningful, both approaches test the @ref qutest_mock-cut "same CUT".

@note
Because of the different design philosophy of QUTest, which is *not* based on xUnit, the classic "mock object" is actually not needed and can be replaced with a simpler "spy" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double" target="_blank" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>test double</b></a>. To dynamically alter the behavior of this "spy" test double, this example applies @ref qutest_fixture-probe "QUTest Test Probes". Test Probes can be changed interactively from the @ref qutest_mock-script "test script".


@remark
Since the @ref qutest_mock-cut "CUT" is in C, the Mock Unity example is only available in the [<b>QP/C framework</b>](https://www.state-machine.com/qpc) (and is **not** available in the [QP/C++ framework](https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp)).<br>
<br>
This simple example runs QUTest tests on the host (Windows, Linux, or macOS) for both Unity and QUTest. The QUTest version also runs on embedded boards (NUCLEO-L053R8 from ST, EFM32 Pearl-Gecko board from Silicon Labs and TivaC LaunchPad from Texas Instruments and ). The instructions for building and running the code on the embedded boards are located at the end of this lesson.

![Targets for this example](platforms.png)


@section qutest_mock-cut Code Under Test (CUT)
The CUT in this example implements a simple bar of 5 LEDs that displays percentage, as shown in the animation below. The "LedBar device" interacts with the discrete LEDs by turning them on and off to achieve the desired effect. The main objective of this example is to demonstrate how to verify the **collaboration** with the discrete LEDs, even without the actual hardware.

![Bar of 5 LEDs displaying the percentage](ledbar5.gif)


The LedBar CUT is located in the file <span class="img file_c">`LedBar.c`</span> in the directory <span class="img folder">`qpc\examples\qutest\unity_ledbar\src`</span>. The CUT consists of just one function `LedBar_setPercent()`, which turns the individual LEDs on and off such that they display the desired `percent` parameter. The function `LedBar_setPercent()` returns the total power consumption (in microwatts) of all LEDs that are turned on.

@anchor qutest_tut_mock-cut
@includelineno LedBar.c
@caption{file LedBar.c}


The low-level interface to the LEDs is defined below (<span class="img file_h">`Led.h`</span>). The individual LEDs are selected by an `index` parameter. Each individual LED can be turned on by means of the `LED_on()` function. The `LED_on()` function returns a value, which corresponds to power consumption of this LED while on. The LED can be turned off by the `LED_off()` function, which returns `void`.

@includelineno Led.h
@caption{file Led.h}


The diagram below shows the relationships between the CUT and the test code: Unity case on the left and QUTest case on the right. In both cases, the `LedBar` CUT interacts with the hardware through the `Led.h` interface. The explanation section below the diagram clarifies the interesting elements of the diagram.

  <dt>1</dt><dd> The `LedBar.c` file contains the @ref qutest_mock-cut "Code Under Test (CUT)".

<strong>Left: Unity testing framework (traditional approach)</strong>
<dl class="tag">

  <dt>3</dt><dd> The `TestLedBar.c` file implements the Unity test fixture, which calls the CUT and verifies that it performs as expected.

> <b>NOTE:</b> A Unity test fixture for a mock requires a special "test runner", which initializes and cleans up after the mock. This "test runner" must typically be generated automatically, as it is too complex to code manually.
  </dd>
  <dt>4</dt><dd>
The Unity test fixture uses the `MockLed.c` implementation of the `Led.h` interface. The mock object implemented in `MockLed.c` needs to be "programmed" for each expected scenario **before** calling the CUT. Thus the structure of conventional tests with a mock is "backwards", meaning that you first specify the expectations and the test ends with a call to the CUT.

> <b>NOTE:</b> This mock-object must typically be generated automatically, as it is too complex to code manually. Here, the mock- object was generated by means of the <a href="http://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock/" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>CMock tool</b></a>, which is included with Unity, but requires installation of the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby programming language</a>.

<strong>Right: QUTest testing framework (simplified approach)</strong>
<dl class="tag">
  <dt>5</dt><dd>
The `test_LedBar.c` file implements the @ref qutest_mock-fixture "QUTest test fixture", which calls the CUT, but it does **NOT** check whether it performs as expected.
  </dd>
  <dt>6</dt><dd>
The QUTest test fixture uses the `spy_Led.c` implementation of the `Led.h` interface. This spy test double is much simpler than the mock-object used by Unity, so it can easily be @ref qutest_mock-spy "coded manually".
  </dd>
  <dt>7</dt><dd>
The QUTest test is driven by the `test_LedBar.py` @ref qutest_mock-script "test script". This test script sends commands to the `test_LedBar.c` fixture and verifies the generated output against the expectations of the test.

@section qutest_mock-run0 Running the Test with Unity
The complete code for the mock Unity example is provided in the QP/C framework directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_ledbar\test_unity`</span>. To run the mock Unity test (on Windows), open a command-prompt and type:
@verbatim
cd C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_ledbar\test_unity
make
@endverbatim

@note
The provided `Makefile` will also work on Linux and macOS. The only difference from Windows is that you open a terminal window and change the directory to <span class="img folder">`~/qp/qpc/examples/qutest/unity_ledbar/test`</span>.


This will build the @ref qutest_mock-fixture "test fixture" as a host executable and then it will run it. The screen shot below shows the output produced from the make command.

@section qutest_mock-run Running the Test with QUTest
The complete code for the mock Unity example is provided in the QP/C framework, directory <span class="img folder">`C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_ledbar\test`</span>. To run the mock test (on Windows), open a command prompt and type:

@verbatim
qspy
@endverbatim

This will start the @ref qspy "QSPY host utility" with the TCP/IP connection to the Target.

Next, open a **second** command prompt window and type:

@verbatim
cd C:\qp\qpc\examples\qutest\unity_ledbar\test
make
@endverbatim

@note
The provided `Makefile` will also work on Linux and macOS. The only difference from Windows is that you open a terminal window and change the directory to <span class="img folder">`~/qp/qpc/examples/qutest/unity_ledbar/qutest`</span>.


This will build the @ref qutest_mock-fixture "test fixture" as a host executable and then it will run the @ref qutest_mock-script "test script" (in Python). The screen shot below shows the output produced in these two command-prompt windows.

@section qutest_mock-script Test Script
The following listing shows the *test script* for the LedBar tests (file <span class="img file_py">`test_LedBar.py`</span>). The explanation section following the listing clarifies the interesting lines of code (lines starting with `[xx]` labels).

@note
The following test script performs the same tests as the `TestLedBar.c` Unity test fixture. Compared to the mock-object approach, however, the QUTest test script has the more intuitive structure, in which a command triggering CUT is **followed** by the expecations. In contrast, the traditional @ref qutest_mock-unity "Unity tests with mock-object" were structured "backwards" (the expectations **preceded** the call to CUT).

/*! @page qutest_qhsm Hierarchical State Machine Example

@tableofcontents
@nav{qutest_mock,qutest_blinky}

<p>This example shows how to apply QUTest for unit-testing [Hierarchical State Machines](https://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts.php#HSM). This example illustrates two testing strategies for state machines:
</p>

- **Functional tests** focus on the *actions* performed by the state machine.

> <b>NOTE:</b> As described in the @ref qutest_mock, testing of complex, multi-stage interactions (such as a state machine) typically requires application of a "mock object" test double. However, the QUTest design philosophy allows you to use a much simpler "spy object" test double instead. The **functional testing** strategy illustrates this approach.

- **Structural tests** focus on the state machine structure, such as entering/exiting *states* and executing *state transitions*.

> <b>NOTE:</b> Unlike the previous examples (@ref qutest_unity "Unity-basic" and @ref qutest_mock "Unity-mock"), which pertained to generic C code, the **structural testing** of state machine makes use of the specific state machine instrumentation that is provided in QP.

@remark
In practice, unit-testing of state machines typically involves a mixture of functional and structural testing strategies.


@section qutest_qhsm-cut  Code Under Test (CUT)
This example is available in both [<b>QP/C</b>](https://www.state-machine.com/qpc) as well as in [<b>QP/C++</b>](https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp) frameworks.The complete code for the `qhsm` example is provided in the directory <span class="img folder">`<qpc|qpcpp>\examples\qutest\qhsmtst`</span>.

The hierarchical state machine used in this example is artificial, but it has been specifically designed to contain all possible state transition topologies for up to 4 levels of state nesting. The code representing this state machine  (the CUT here), has been generated automatically by the [QM modeling tool](https://www.state-machine.com/qm/) from the model shown in the screen-shot below:

![QHsmTst state machine in QM](qhsmtst_qm.png)

The state machine executes actions on every entry/exit to states, on state transitions and on internal state transitions. These actions are all implemented by calling the `BSP_display()` function that outputs a succinct message about the location of the action within the state machine. For example, the entry action to state "s2" calls `BSP_display("s2-ENTRY;")` and the exit action from state "s2" calls `BSP_display("s2-EXIT;")`. These actions then are used for @ref qutest_qhsm-funct-script "functional testing" of the state machine.


@section qutest_qhsm-run Running the Test
To run the `qhsm` tests (on Windows), open a command prompt and type:

@verbatim
qspy
@endverbatim

This will start the @ref qspy "QSPY" host application with the TCP/IP connection to the Target.

Next, open another command prompt window and type:

@verbatim
cd C:\qp\<qpc|qpcpp>\examples\qutest\qhsmtst\test
make
@endverbatim

This will build the @ref qutest_qhsm-fixture "test fixture" as a Windows executable and then it will run the @ref qutest_qhsm-funct-script "test script". The screen shot below shows the output produced in these two command-prompt windows.

@section qutest_qhsm-fixture Test Fixture
The following listing shows the test fixture for the QHsm tests (file <span class="img file_c">`test_qhsm.c`</span>). This test fixture is used in both @ref qutest_qhsm-funct-script "functional" and @ref qutest_qhsm-struct-script "structural" tests. The explanation section following the listing clarifies the interesting lines of code (lines starting with [xx] labels).

@subsection qutest_qhsm-act Action Functions Test Doubles
For functional testing, which is focused on the **actions** performed by a state machine, the actions must generate some QS output. This QS instrumentation can be added either directly to the state machine model, or indirectly to the functions called from the state machine actions. The test fixture above illustrates the second option, because it was more convenient in this case (see `BSP_display()` implementation starting at label [6] above).

<dl class="tag">
  <dt>6</dt><dd> The function `BSP_display()` is called from all actions of the state machine. Inside the test fixture, this function is defined to produce QS output. This is a classic example of a "spy" test double.
  </dd>
  <dt>7</dt><dd> The QS output is produced with an @ref qs_app "application-specific trace record" enumerated at label [1]. The second argument to the QS_BEGIN() macro is zero, which means that this   record does not use any @ref qs_local "local filter".
  </dd>
  <dt>8</dt><dd> The QS_STR() data element outputs the message string.
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>

@remark
In practice, you will likely use both functional and structural testing at the same time. Simple actions that do not perform any hardware-specific operations could be instrumented (with @ref qs_app "QS application-specific trace records") directly in the CUT (your state machines). The hardware-specific actions need to be abstracted anyway (in the BSP for "dual targeting"), in which case you can place the QS instrumentation in the BSP only.
