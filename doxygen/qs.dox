/*! @page qs QS Target Component

@tableofcontents

<p>The target-resident component of the QP/Spy&trade; tracing system is called **QS**. The purpose of QS is to provide facilities for **instrumenting** the target code so that it will produce interesting real-time trace from code execution. In this sense it is similar to peppering the code with `printf` statements. However, the main difference between QS and `printf` is *where* the data **formatting** and **sending** is done. When you use `printf`s, the data formatting and sending occur in the time-critical paths through your embedded code. In contrast, the QS target-resident component inserts raw binary data into the QS ring buffer, so all the time-consuming formatting is removed from the Target system and is done *after* the fact in the Host. Additionally, in QS, data logging and sending to the Host are separated so that the target system can typically perform the transmission outside of the time-critical path, for example in the *idle processing* of the target CPU.
</p>

The QS target component consists of the QS ring buffer, the QS filters, as well as the instrumentation added to the QP framework and the application, as shown in figure below. Additionally, the QS target component contains the receive-channel (@ref qs_rx "QS-RX") with its own receive buffer, which can receive data from the QSPY host component.

A nice byproduct of removing the data formatting from the Target is a natural **data compression**. For example, formatted output of a single byte takes two hexadecimal digits(and 3 decimal digits), so avoiding the formatting gives at least a factor of two in data density. On top of this natural compression, QS uses such techniques as data dictionaries, and compressed format information, which in practice result in compression factor of 4-5 compared to the expanded human-readable format.

@attention
The QS instrumentation is designed such that it is active only in the *Spy build configuration* (when the external macro #Q_SPY is defined) and is **inactive** otherwise. This means that you don't need to comment-out or remove the instrumentation in the Debug or Release build configurations, but rather you can **leave** the instrumentation in your code for its future development, testing, profiling and maintenance.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_tstamp Target Time-Stamps
Most QS trace records produced by QS are **time-stamped** with a high-resolution counter (the resolution depends on the availability of a hardware timer-counter in the Target, but typically provides sub-microsecond granularity). QS provides an efficient API for obtaining platform-specific timestamp information. Given the right timer-counter resource in you Target system, you can provide QS with as precise timestamp information as required. The size of the timestamp is configurable to be 1, 2, or 4 bytes (see #QS_TIME_SIZE).

@note
The QS **timestamps** are used differently in the @ref qutest "QUTest&trade;" unit testing. In that case the timestamps are used to count the QS records produced.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_pre Predefined QS Trace Records
The <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpc">QP/C</a> and <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp">QP/C++</a> frameworks contain the QS instrumentation for tracing the interesting occurrences within the frameworks, such as state machines activity (dispatching events, entering/exiting a state, executing transitions, etc.), active object activity (allocating events, posting/publishing events, time events, etc.), and more. All this instrumentation generates some 70 **predefined** QS trace records, which are enumerated in ::QSpyRecords. These QS records have pre-defined (hard-coded) structure both in the QS target-resident component and the @ref qspy "QSPY" host-based application. See also the documentation of the @ref qspy_pre "human-readable output" generated from the predefined QS records.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_app Application-Specific QS Trace Records
Additionally to the predefined QS records, you can add your own, flexible, **application-specific** trace records, which are not known in advance to the @ref qspy "QSPY" host-resident component. You can think of the application-specific records as an equivalent to `printf()` but with much less overhead. The following code snippet shows an example of an application-specific QS record from your embedded code:

@code
enum MyAppRecords {
    PHILO_STAT = QS_USER, /* offset for User QS Records */
    COMMAND_STAT,
    ~ ~ ~
};
~ ~ ~
QS_BEGIN(PHILO_STAT, AO_Philo[n]) /* application-specific record begin */
    QS_U8(1, n);  /* application-specific data element (Philo number) */
    QS_STR(stat); /* application-specific data element (Philo status) */
QS_END()          /* application-specific record end */
@endcode

As you can see from the example above, an application-specific trace record always begins with QS_BEGIN(), followed by a number of @ref qs_app_el "application-specific data elements", followed by QS_END().

@attention
The application-specific records use the 55 @ref qpspy_proto "record-IDs" in the range #QS_USER .. 124 (see also User-All group in @ref qs_global "Global Filters"). Therefore, you need to **offset** your application-specific trace records by the #QS_USER constant to avoid overlap with the @ref qs_pre "predefined QS records" already instrumented into the QP components.

@note
As all QS trace records, the application-specific records are produced in a critical section of code (interrupts disabled). Therefore, you should keep the number of @ref qs_app_el "application-specific data elements" of the record reasonably short.


<div class="separate"></div>
@subsection qs_app_rep Application-Specific Record Representation
The biggest challenge in supporting flexible "application-specific" trace records is to provide the data type information with the data itself, so that @ref qspy "QSPY" "knows" how to parse such record and move on to the next data element within the record. The figure below shows the encoding of the application-specific trace record from the listing previous.

@image html qspy_app.gif "Structure of an Application-Specific trace record"

The application-specific trace record, like all @ref qpspy_proto "QS records", starts with the Sequence Number and the
Record-ID. Every application-specific trace record also contains the @ref qs_tstamp "timestamp" immediately following the Record ID. The number of bytes used by the
timestamp is configurable by the macro #QS_TIME_SIZE. After the timestamp, you see the data elements, such as a byte (QS_U8()) and a string (QS_STR()). Each of these data elements starts with a fmt (format) byte, which actually contains both the data-type information (in the lower nibble) and the format width for displaying that element (in the upper nibble). For example, the data element QS_U8(1, n) will cause the value 'n' to be encoded as u`int8_t` with the format width of 1 decimal digits.

@remark
The maximum allowed format width is 15 decimal digits, while format width of 0 means that a numeric value should be formatted in minimum number of digits.

As shown in the listing above, typically the application-specific records are enclosed with the QS_BEGIN() / QS_END() pair of macros. This pair of macros disables interrupts at the beginning and enables at the end of each record. Occasionally you would want to generate trace data from within already established critical sections or ISRs. In such rare occasions, you would use the macros QS_BEGIN_NOCRIT() / QS_END_NOCRIT() to avoid nesting of critical sections.

The record-begin macro QS_BEGIN() takes two arguments. The first argument (e.g., `PHILO_STAT`) is the enumerated @ref qpspy_proto "record-ID", which is used in the @ref qs_global "global filter" and is part of the each record header.

The second argument (e.g., `AO_Philo[n]` in the example above) is used for the @ref qs_local "local filter", which allows you to selectively log only specific application-level objects. The code snippet shows an example of an application-specific trace record, including the use of the second parameter of the QS_BEGIN() macro.

@section qs_filters QS Filters
Obviously, QS cannot eliminate completely the overhead of software tracing. But with the fine-granularity <strong>filters</strong> available in QS, you can make this impact as small as necessary. For greatest flexibility, QS uses two complementary levels of filters: **Global Filters** and **Local Filters** described below. Combination of such two complementary filtering criteria results in very selective tracing capabilities.

@note
The Global and Local filters are initialized in the Target. Subsequently, if the QS receive channel is enabled (@ref qs_rx "QS-RX"), the filters can be changed from the @ref qutest "QUTest" or @ref qspyview "QSpyView" front-ends at **runtime**.


<div class="separate"></div>
@subsection qs_global Global Filters
The Global Filters are based on trace @ref qpspy_proto "Record-ID" associated with each QS record (see ::QSpyRecords). This filter allows you to disable or enable each individual Record-ID, such as entry to a state (::QS_QEP_STATE_ENTRY), exit from a state (::QS_QEP_STATE_EXIT), state transition (::QS_QEP_INIT_TRAN ), event posting (::QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO), event publishing (::QS_QF_PUBLISH ), time event expiration (::QS_QF_TIMEEVT_POST), and all other pre-defined and application-specific event types. This level works globally for all state machines, active objects, and time event objects in the entire system.

QS provides a simple interface for setting and clearing individual Record-IDs as well as groups of Record-IDs in the Target code:

- QS_FILTER_ON()
- QS_FILTER_OFF()

The following table summarizes the Record-IDs and groups of Record-IDs that you can use as arguments to QS_FILTER_ON() and QS_FILTER_OFF()

@n
<center>

</center>
@n

@note
The QS global filter cannot disable a special class of QS records, which are called **non-maskable**. These non-maskable records include: @ref qs_dict "dictionary records", target-information records, QS-RX status responses, QUTest-status responses, and the Target assertion record.


<div class="separate"></div>
@subsection qs_local Local Filters
The Local Filters are component-specific. You can setup a filter to trace only a specific state machine object, only a specific active object, only a specific time event, etc. The following table summarizes the specific objects you can filter on:

<center>
Object@n Type | Example | Applies to QS Records
--------------|---------|----------------------
State@n Machine | QS_FILTER_SM_OBJ(&l_qhsmTst); | #QS_QEP_STATE_ENTRY,@n #QS_QEP_STATE_EXIT,@n #QS_QEP_STATE_INIT,@n #QS_QEP_INIT_TRAN,@n #QS_QEP_INTERN_TRAN,@n #QS_QEP_TRAN,@n #QS_QEP_IGNORED,@n #QS_QEP_TRAN_HIST,@n #QS_QEP_TRAN_EP,@n #QS_QEP_TRAN_XP
Active@n Object | QS_FILTER_AO_OBJ(&l_philo[3]); | #QS_QF_ACTIVE_ADD,@n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_REMOVE,@n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_SUBSCRIBE,@n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_UNSUBSCRIBE,@n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO, @n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,@n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET, @n #QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET_LAST
Event@n Queue | QS_FILTER_EQ_OBJ(l_philQueueSto[0]); | #QS_QF_EQUEUE_INIT,@n #QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_FIFO,@n #QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_LIFO,@n #QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET,@n #QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET_LAST
Memory@n Pool | QS_FILTER_MP_OBJ(l_medPoolSto); | #QS_QF_MPOOL_INIT,@n #QS_QF_MPOOL_GET,@n #QS_QF_MPOOL_PUT
Time@n Event  | QS_FILTER_TE_OBJ(&l_philo[0] timeEvt); | #QS_QF_TICK,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_ARM,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_AUTO_DISARM,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_DISARM_ATTEMPT,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_DISARM,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_REARM,@n #QS_QF_TIMEEVT_POST
Generic@n Application@n Object | QS_FILTER_AP_OBJ(&myAppObj); | Application-specific records@n starting with #QS_USER
</center>

@note
Local filters can be disabled by setting them to `NULL`. For example, if you wish to receive data from **all** state machine objects, you should set the State Machine local filter to NULL ( QS_FILTER_SM_OBJ((void*)0 ).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_curr Current Objects
QS maintains a set of **Current Objects**, to which it applies commands received through the @ref qs_rx "QS-RX channel". For example, the event-post operation is applied to the current Active Object, while the peek/poke/fill operations are applied to the current Application Object. QS maintains the following Current Objects:
- State Machine object
- Active Object object
- Memory Pool object
- Event Queue object
- Time Event object

@note
Current Objects can be set only by sending commands to the @ref qs_rx "QS-RX receive channel".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_dict QS Dictionaries
By the time you compile and load your application image to the Target, the symbolic names of various objects, function names, and event signal names are stripped from the code. Therefore, if you want to have the symbolic information available to the @ref qspy "QSPY" host-resident component, you need to supply it somehow to the software tracing system.

The QS Target-resident component provides special **dictionary trace records** designed expressly for providing the symbolic information about the target code in the trace itself. These "dictionary records" are very much like the symbolic information embedded in the object files for the traditional single-step debugger. QS can supply four types of dictionary trace records:

- object dictionary ( QS_OBJ_DICTIONARY() )
- function dictionary  ( QS_FUN_DICTIONARY() )
- signal dictionary  ( QS_SIG_DICTIONARY() )
- user dictionary  ( QS_USR_DICTIONARY() )

The dictionary trace records are typically generated during the system initialization and this is the only time when they are sent to the @ref qspy "QSPY" host component. It is **your** responsibility to code them in (by means of the `QS_???_DICTIONARY()` macros). The following code snippet provides some examples of generating QS dictionaries:

@code
void main(void) {
    ~ ~ ~
    /* global filter */
    QS_FILTER_ON(QS_ALL_RECORDS); /* enable all maskable filters */

    /* dictionaries... */
    QS_OBJ_DICTIONARY(buffer);
    QS_FUN_DICTIONARY(&myFun);

    QS_USR_DICTIONARY(ON_TEST_SETUP);
    QS_USR_DICTIONARY(ON_TEST_TEARDOWN);
    QS_USR_DICTIONARY(COMMAND_X);
    ~ ~ ~
}
@endcode

@note
The dictionary trace records are not absolutely required to generate the human-readable output, in the same way as the symbolic information in the object files is not absolutely required to debug your code. However, in both cases, the availability of the symbolic information greatly improves the productivity in working with the software trace or the debugger.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section qs_rx QS-RX Receive-Channel
The QS target component contains the receive-channel (QS-RX), which can receive data from the @ref qspy "QSPY" host application. The QS-RX channel provides the following services:
- Remotely reset of the Target
- Request target information (version, all sizes of objects, build time-stamp)
- Execute a user-defined command inside the Target with arguments supplied from @ref qspy "QSPY"
- Inject an arbitrary event to the Target (dispatch, post or publish)
- Set @ref qs_global "global QS filters" inside the Target
- Set @ref qs_local "local QS filters" inside the Target
- Set @ref qs_curr "current QS object" inside the Target
- Peek data inside the Target and send to @ref qspy "QSPY"
- Poke data (supplied from @ref qspy "QSPY") into the Target
- Fill specified memory area in the Target with bit pattern supplied from @ref qspy "QSPY"
- Execute clock tick inside the Target
- Execute test setup inside the Target
- Execute test teardown inside the Target
- Store a @ref qutest_tp "Test Probe" supplied from @ref qspy "QSPY" inside the Target

@note
The QS-RX channel is the backbone for interacting with the target system and implemeting such features as @ref qutest "Unit Testing" and @ref qspyview "Visualization/Monitoring" of the target system.
