About Qtools
============
Qtools is a collection of various open source tools for working with the
QP state machine frameworks on desktop platforms, such as Windows,
Linux, and Mac OS X.

The following open-source tools are currently provided by Quantum Leaps:

1. qspy     - host application for receiving and displaying the
              real-time data from embedded targets running the QS
              software tracing.

2. qspyview - Tcl/Tk extension of the QSPY host application for control
              testing, and visualization of the QS real-time tracing
              data from embedded targets at real-time. QSpyView enables
              developers to rapidly build both GUI-based and "headless"
              scripts for their specific applications.

3. qwin_gui - QWIN GUI toolkit for prototyping embedded systems on
              Windows in the C programming language. QWIN allows you
              to build realistic embedded front panels consisting of
              LCD displays (both graphical and segmented), buttons,
              and LEDs. QWIN is based on the Win32 API.

3. qclean   - for cleanup of source code files

4. qfsgen   - for generating ROM-based file systems to be used
              in embedded web pages served by the HTTP server

5. qudp     - for testing UDP connections to the embedded targets
6. qudps    - UDP server for testing UDP connections to the embedded
              targets.
7. mscgen   - for converting .msc files generated by qspy into
              message sequence charts (MSC) in various graphic formats.

Additionally, Qtools for Windows contains the following open-source,
3rd-party tools:

8. GNU-make for Windows (version 3.82)

9. GNU C/C++ toolset for Windows (MinGW version 4.5.2)

10. TCL/TK for Windows (version 8.4) with UDP sockets extension

11. AVRDUDE for Windows (version 6.1)


Additionally, Qtools for Windows contains the following PC-Lint option
files various compilers (in sub-directory lint):

13. co-gnu-arm.* (PC-Lint option files for GNU-ARM)

14. co-iar-arm.* (PC-Lint option files for IAR-ARM)


Installation
============
Installation of Qtools is trivial and consists merely of unzipping the
qtools_<ver>.zip archive into a directory of your choice.

******
NOTE: To use the Qtools, you should add the <qtools>\bin directory to
the PATH, where <qtools> denotes the directory where you have unzipped
the qtools_<ver>.zip archive.

NOTE: To use the Qtools source code (such as parts of the QSPY) in
builds of the QP library, you need to define the environment variable
QTOOLS to point to the installation directory of Qtools.
******

On Linux you must additionally make sure that the executables, such as
qspy, qclean, etc. have the 'executable' property set.


Licensing

the Qtools distribution.


Documentation
=============
The documentation of the tools is provided in the <qtools>\doc\
directory. Specifically, the PDF version of the make manual is included.
A we-link to the TCL/TK documentation is provided in the shortcut
tcl_tk_8.4.


QSPYView Tcl/Tk Scripts
=======================
The QSpyView Tcl/Tk scripts for the QSPY utility are located in the
<qtools>\qspy\qspyview\ directory.


QSPY Matlab Scripts
===================
The Matlab/GNU Octave scripts for the QSPY utility are located in the
<qtools>\qspy\matlab\ directory.


QSPY Sequence Diagrams Examples
===============================
The sequence diagram input files for the MSCgen utility and the
generated sequence diagrams (in the SVG format) are located in the
<qtools>\qspy\mscgen\ directory.


Source Code
===========
In compliance with GPL, this distribution contains the source code for
the utilities contributed by Quantum Leaps in the <qtools>\source\
subdirectory, except for the QSPY source code, which is provided in the
<qtools>\qspy\source directory. All tools with names starting with 'q'
have been developed and are copyrighted by Quantum Leaps.
